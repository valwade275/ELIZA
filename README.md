# ELIZA

With the proliferation of AI chatbots in our everyday lives, I wanted to explore one of the earliest chatbots. ELIZA was developed in the 1960s by Joseph Weizenbaum. My ELIZA project is a very simple implementation using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It is helping me become comfortable with logic and various JavaScript functions. 

I have also included a markdown file which serves as documentation for my chatbot.
